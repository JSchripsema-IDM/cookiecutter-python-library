## Github Actions
There are three types of github actions that are configured by default.

* Bump Version
  * For "release" branches automatically bumps the patch version for every checkin
  * Will automatically bump specified version part when a commit message containing \*\*\*BUMP \<version-part\>\*\*\* is pushed. For example: \*\*\*BUMP MINOR\*\*\* increments the minor version.
* Build/Test
  * Builds the package as a wheel file, determines that wheel file exists, installs the built wheel file, runs python tests (using pytest) in the ./tests sub-directory
  * Configured to run on ubuntu (python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8), and windows (python 3.6)
* Build/Test/Publish
  * For "release" branches automatically publishes to staging a successfully built (and tested) package

### Docs

Creating a project from this template also creates files for a simple stubbed documentation source files. Guidance on how to write documenation is available at https://docs.idmod.org/projects/doc-guidance/en/latest/. Contact Jen Schripsema to create a project on Read the Docs to automatically build and host the HTML documentation.
